# AutTalk
For our Project we were asked to create Universal Windows Project which will demonstrate the use of isolated storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. For my App i chose Local Storage and Sound.

## What is AutTalk?
AutTalk is a SoundBoard App which displays icons which when tapped or clicked will output a sound message. The App was created to help non-verbal Autistic people to communicate easier with friends and family. The idea came from when talking to my sister about work. She is a social care worker and mainly deals with Austistic children. She loves working with them but she says it is very frustrating for the children and for the workers with no comunication. 
There has already been other SoundBoard Apps created but she said alot of them have been overly complicated. So i decided to create a simplistic version with only the needs wants and interactions of the Autistic person. I also implented a notes board for the carer/family/friend to write notes of what happened during the day aswell as favorite sound board buttons and also ones which he/she may not recognize yet.
